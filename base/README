Introduction
================================
The FASP package is designed for developing and testing new efficient solvers 
and preconditioners for discrete partial differential equations (PDEs) or 
systems of PDEs. The main components of the package are standard Krylov methods, 
algebraic multigrid methods, and incomplete factorization methods. Based on 
these standard techniques, we build efficient solvers, based on the framework 
of Auxiliary Space Preconditioning, for several complicated applications. 
Current examples include the fluid dynamics, underground water simulation, 
the black oil model in reservoir simulation, and so on. 

More details about the FASP project can be found at http://fasp.sourceforge.net.
