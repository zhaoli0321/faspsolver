Introduction
================================
This directory contains a set of problems for regression tests and tools for 
developing the FASP package.

The FASP package is designed for developing and testing new efficient solvers 
and preconditioners for discrete partial differential equations (PDEs) or 
systems of PDEs. The main components of the package are standard Krylov methods, 
algebraic multigrid methods, and incomplete factorization methods. Based on 
these standard techniques, we build efficient solvers, based on the framework 
of Auxiliary Space Preconditioning, for several complicated applications. 
Current examples include the fluid dynamics, underground water simulation, 
the black oil model in reservoir simulation, and so on. 

More details about the FASP project can be found at http://fasp.sourceforge.net.

================================
Test
================================
By running the executable test.ex, we can get numerical results for different test 
examples. The terminal command to invoke the test problems is

    $ ./test.ex

which tests a bunch of solvers at a single call. 


================================
Input
================================
And test.ex reads parameters from ini/input.dat, where you can choose:

* solver type:   1  CG method
                 2  BiCGstab method
                 3  MinRes method
                 4  GMRes method
                 5  Variable restarting GMRes method
                 6  Variable restarting FGMRes method
                 7  GCG method
                 21 AMG as solver
                 22 FMG as solver
                 31 SuperLU (external)
                 32 UMFPACK (external)

* precond type:  0  No preconditioners
                 1  Diagonal preconditioner
                 2  AMG preconditioner
                 3  ILU preconditioner (external)

* solver parameters (which we do not discuss here, see details in the documentation 
  	 	     contained in doc directory).

  - coarsening type ( 1--3 )
  - interpolation type ( 1--3 ) 
  - max_row_sum ( 0, 1 )
  - strong_threshold ( 0, 1 )
  - truncation_threshold ( 0, 1 )

Note: This is not a complete list of available parameters. For more details, please 
refer to the user documentation.
